## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a **Computer Science Explorer** 🌐 with a strong passion for:  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity** – Breaking into systems (ethically 😉) before the bad guys do.  
- ⚡ **C / C++** – For the raw power & control over machines.  
- 🎨 **Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** – Crafting sleek & interactive UIs.  
- 🐍 **Python** – Automating chaos & making life simpler.  
- 🎮 **Game Development (a little)** – Because why just play games when you can build them?
